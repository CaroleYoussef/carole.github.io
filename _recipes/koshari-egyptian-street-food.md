## Recipe Information

- **Cook Time**: 25 minutes
- **Total Time**: 45 minutes
- **Servings**: 4 people
- **Difficulty**: Medium
- **Cuisine**: Egyptian

## Ingredients

### Main Components
- 1 cup long-grain rice
- 1 cup brown lentils
- 1 cup elbow macaroni
- 1 can (15 oz) chickpeas, drained and rinsed

### For the Sauce
- 2 large onions, thinly sliced
- 4 cloves garlic, minced
- 2 tbsp tomato paste
- 1 tsp ground cumin
- 1 tsp ground coriander
- 1/2 tsp chili powder (optional)
- Salt and black pepper to taste
- 2 tbsp olive oil

### For Garnish
- Fresh parsley, chopped
- Lemon wedges
- Hot sauce (optional)

## Instructions

### Step 1: Cook the Base Ingredients

1. **Cook the rice**: Rinse rice until water runs clear. Cook according to package instructions (usually 1 cup rice to 2 cups water). Set aside.

2. **Cook the lentils**: Rinse lentils and place in a pot with 3 cups water. Bring to boil, then simmer for 20-25 minutes until tender but not mushy. Drain and set aside.

3. **Cook the pasta**: Boil macaroni according to package instructions until al dente. Drain and set aside.

### Step 2: Prepare the Sauce

1. **Caramelize the onions**: Heat olive oil in a large pan over medium heat. Add sliced onions and cook slowly, stirring occasionally, until golden brown and crispy (about 15-20 minutes). Remove half for garnish.

2. **Make the tomato sauce**: In the same pan, add minced garlic and cook for 1 minute until fragrant. Add tomato paste and spices, cook for 2 minutes while stirring.

3. **Add chickpeas**: Add drained chickpeas to the sauce and cook for 5 minutes, allowing flavors to meld. Season with salt and pepper to taste.

### Step 3: Assemble the Dish

1. **Layer the ingredients**: In a large serving dish, create layers:
   - Bottom layer: Rice
   - Middle layer: Lentils
   - Top layer: Macaroni

2. **Add the sauce**: Pour the tomato-chickpea mixture over the layers.

3. **Garnish**: Top with crispy onions, chopped parsley, and serve with lemon wedges and hot sauce on the side.

## Tips & Notes

- **Make ahead**: You can prepare all components up to 2 days in advance and assemble just before serving.
- **Onion technique**: The key to great koshari is properly caramelizing the onions. Take your time with this step!
